# inventory-app
The inventory management app project in The Odin Project's Node JS course.

TODO BEFORE PROD:
- change DB_URL
- change db/populatedb.js to take args

Future work that can be done:
- Implement filtering (by author/genre),
- Implement sorting,
- Add more error handling where missing (i.e. missing page, etc),
- Add search options other than "keyword" (search by title, search by author, etc.),
- Allow books to have more than 1 author/genre,
- Use modals instead of separate pages to add/edit items,
- Allow searching to be non-case-sensitive,
- Add a dropdown for all available genres in the forms,
- Auto-convert inputted genres to all lowercase,
- Use icons and other styling.
